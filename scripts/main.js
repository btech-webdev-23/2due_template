//* Select the down arrow button and add a click event listener.
//* Call a function called scrollTo that takes in an element as a parameter that it will scroll to.

//* Create a function called scrollTo that takes in an element as a parameter.
//* Select the element from the DOM and add the scrollIntoView method to it.
//* Pass an object into the scrollIntoView method with the block property set

//* Create two variables called count and wordsArray.
//* Set count to 0 and wordsArray to an array of strings, which contain the words you want to cycle through.
//* Create a setInterval function that takes in a callback function and a number.
//* The callback function will be named changeText and will take in no parameters.
//* Set the number to 5000, which will be the number of milliseconds between each change.

//* Create a function called changeText. Inside, the count should increment by 1.
//* Using the altText variable you created earlier, use the fadeOut method to fade out the text.
//* The fadeout method takes in a number as a parameter, which is the number of milliseconds it will take to fade out. The second parameter is a callback function that will be called when the fadeOut method is complete.
//* The callback function will use the text method to change the text to the next word in the wordsArray. You can achieve this using the .text method and the modulo operator. The modulo operator will return the remainder of the count divided by the length of the wordsArray. This will allow you to cycle through the wordsArray.
//* Fade in the text using the jQuery fadeIn method. The fadeIn method takes in a number as a parameter, which is the number of milliseconds it will take to fade in.
